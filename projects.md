OPTIHYP
-----------------
07/2015 – 09/2018   
**Hybrid Power Plants for Polygeneration – OPTIHYP**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Principal investigator:_ Dr. Fontina Petrakopoulou   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Supported by:_ European Union (MC-COFUND, FP7)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Project duration:_ 36 months (start July 2015)   

>OPTIHYP will propose and evaluate novel integrated hybrid-polygeneration systems to support the sustainable energy development of European regions, as well as link strategic energy planning with European policies, social considerations and environmental impacts. Renewable and conventional energy sources will be coupled in advanced systems that incorporate both new and conventional energy conversion technologies. These systems will be optimized using an innovative multi-criteria method focused on efficiency maximization and the minimization of water usage, environmental impacts and costs. Thermodynamic, economic, environmental and water usage estimates will be used to create two original databases. This inter-disciplinary project will produce the first open-access, flexible online tool for regional energy planning based on hybrid-polygeneration systems. This web-based tool will be made available to the scientific community, policymakers and the private sector and will lay the foundation for robust optimization strategies in the energy sector.

**Green Energy for Islands – GENERGIS (332028)**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Principal investigator:_ Dr. Fontina Petrakopoulou   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Supported by:_ European Union (MC-IEF, FP7)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Project duration:_ 24 months (start May 2013)

>Green ENERGy for ISlands (GENERGIS) studied and reported paths towards the renewable energy autonomy of Skyros island in Greece.
The goals of the project were to:
(1) address the energy autonomy of the island, including energy storage systems,
(2) involve the people of the community in the decision-making process,
(3) perform detailed technical calculations through simulations, as well as exhaustive economic and environmental analyses,
(4) propose a concrete energy plan for achieving 100% sustainable living,
(5) create the first guide on sustainable development based on social, environmental and economic data.
