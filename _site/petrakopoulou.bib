abstract = {Abstract The ambitious vision of off-grid renewable energy autonomy of remote regions has yet to come to fruition. The development of comprehensive energy production systems would be needed to achieve such a goal. This study consists of the simulation and exergetic evaluation of a novel hybrid power plant for stand-alone operation aiming to provide electricity autonomy of a Mediterranean island. The considered power plant is simulated dynamically over an annual cycle and accounts for both energy input fluctuations and electricity surplus. The plant combines a photovoltaic array with wind turbines for energy input, coupled with electricity storage and a hydrogen generation facility for stable output. Unlike other similar studies, the energy system presented here relies on real-case weather and demand data of a relatively large remote community and is optimized to ensure continuous operation – even under extreme conditions. It is seen that this stand-alone hybrid power plant constitutes a robust and secure alternative to the current conventional energy situation; the combined renewable technologies succeed in complementing each other and offer stable performance throughout the year without the requirement of additional support by fossil fuels. The mean annual exergetic efficiency of the plant is found to be 17.9 {\%}, producing approximately 25,000 {\{}MWh{\}} of electricity per year, along with a secondary product (hydrogen) produced in the electrolyzer of the plant. Although this additional product is associated with additional investment cost, it offers the possibility to stabilize the power plant’s performance and can be used as an additional source of financial input to the community. },

abstract = {Conventional exergy-based methods pinpoint components and processes with high irreversibilities. However, they lack certain insight. For a given advanced technological state, there is a minimum level of exergy destruction related to technological and/or economic constraints that is unavoidable. Furthermore, in any thermodynamic system, exergy destruction stems from both component interactions (exogenous) and component inefficiencies (endogenous). To overcome the limitations of the conventional analyses and to increase our knowledge about a plant, advanced exergy-based analyses have been developed. In this paper, a combined cycle power plant is analyzed using both conventional and advanced exergetic analyses. Except for the expander of the gas turbine system and the high-pressure steam turbine, most of the exergy destruction in the plant components is unavoidable. This unavoidable part is constrained by internal technological limitations, i.e. each component’s endogenous exergy destruction. High levels of endogenous exergy destruction show that component interactions do not contribute significantly to the thermodynamic inefficiencies. In addition, these inefficiencies are unavoidable to a large extent. With the advanced analysis, new improvement strategies are revealed that could not otherwise be found.},

abstract = {CO2 capture from power plants, combined with CO2 storage, is a potential means for limiting the impact of fossil fuel use on the climate. In this paper, three oxy-fuel plants with incorporated CO2 capture are evaluated from an economic and environmental perspective. The oxy-fuel plants, a plant with chemical looping combustion with near 100{\%} CO2 capture and two advanced zero emission plants with 100{\%} and 85{\%} CO2 capture are evaluated and compared to a similarly structured reference plant without CO2 capture. To complete the comparison, the reference plant is also considered with CO2 capture incorporating chemical absorption with monoethanolamine.

For the considered oxy-fuel plants, the investment cost is estimated to be almost double that of the reference plant, mainly due to the equipment used for oxygen production and CO2 compression. Furthermore, the exergoeconomic analysis reveals an increase in the cost of electricity with respect to the reference plant by more than 20{\%}, with the advanced zero emission plant with 85{\%} CO2 capture being the most economical choice. On the other hand, a life cycle assessment reveals a decrease in the environmental impact of the plants with CO2 capture, due to the CO2 and NOx emission control. This leads to a reduction in the overall environmental impact of the plants by more than 20{\%} with respect to the reference plant. The most environmentally friendly concept is the plant with chemical looping combustion.},

abstract = {Normal 0 21 MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 Exergy-based methods can be used as a tool for examining, comparing and assessing thermodynamic systems. In this paper, an exergoeconomic analysis is used to evaluate a power plant with chemical looping combustion (CLC) for CO 2 capture. This oxy-fuel plant is compared, from an exergetic and an economic perspective, to a conventional, reference power plant without CO 2 capture. The exergetic analysis shows decreased exergy destruction in the CLC reactors, compared to the exergy destruction in the conventional combustion chamber of the reference case; thus, the irreversibilities caused by combustion in the CLC are reduced. However, due to the addition of the CO 2 compression unit, the overall exergetic efficiency of the plant with CLC is lower than that of the reference plant by approximately 5 percentage points. The economic analysis confirms a significant increase in the investment cost of the CO 2 capture plant, due to the addition of the units for CO 2 compression and CLC. Thus, the cost of electricity is 24{\%} higher for this plant in comparison to that of the reference case. Nevertheless, when compared to the reference plant with CO 2 capture with monoethanolamine, the plant with CLC was found to be a more economical option. Since CO 2 abatement must be realized in the future, given expected environmental or tax measures, CLC provides relatively low cost carbon dioxide capture and it, therefore, appears to be a promising option for reducing greenhouse gases emitted by power plants using fossil fuels.},
