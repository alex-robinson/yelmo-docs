I received my undergraduate degree in Production Engineering and Management
(Mechanical Engineering) from the Technical University of Crete (2005) and my Ph.D. in
Energy Engineering from the Technical University of Berlin (2010).
I have worked as a researcher in Germany,
Spain and Greece holding European Fellowships (Marie-Curie Actions).

My work focuses on the simulation and optimization of energy conversion processes
using thermodynamic, economic and environmental criteria. The energy conversion
processes I study include, among others, renewable- and fossil-based power plants,
biofuel generation processes and zero-emission energy processes
(including CO2 capture). My work includes the investigation of the
energy autonomy of remote regions fully based on renewable sources.
I am an expert on exergy-based methods and analytical methods used
for the optimization of complex energy systems.

I have taught courses on heat transfer and the optimization of thermodynamic
systems and have supervised a large number of bachelor and master theses.
I have been honoured with a best paper award and my Ph.D. thesis was chosen
as one the three best in Germany by RWE AG. I am the author of various journal
articles and book chapters and have participated in numerous international
conferences and workshops.
